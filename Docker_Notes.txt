Registry:
These are servers where images are placed
The default registry used by Docker is Docker Hub

Private Registry
=================
A registry as a container
DTR
ECR
GCR



When execute a docker file you get image.

Custom image can be shipped to Registry

Those who have access to the registry can access the image



Install Docker
	- yum install docker -y
	
Start Dicker
	- systemctl start docker

Check Status
	- systemctl status docker

List of images in docker
	- docker image ls
	or
	- docker images
	
Pull image
	- docker pull <imagename>
	e.g docker pull ubuntu
	
Remove image
	- docker rmi <imaename>
	
Run Ubuntu
	- docker run ubuntu

Check status
	- docker ps -a
	
whenever u run an image, u get new container

Run options
============
docker run --name <containername> <imagename>
	e.g docker run --name cont1 ubuntu
	
Remove container
	- docker rm -f <containerid>
	
In docker there are two type of modes:
Foreground Mode (-it)
====================
i - interactive t- terminal
> this option (-it) is used with docker run command and then
	- The container will be created
	- Container will be up and running
	- User will be attached to the terminal of the container. That means user will be inside the container

Come out of the container and keep it running
	- CTRL + pq

Go back into the container
	- docker attach <containername>/<containerid>
	
Come out of container and exit 
	- exit
	
Start and Stop a container
	- docker start <containername>
	- docker stop <containername>
	
Clean the docker machine
	- docker system prune --all
	This will remove:
	  - all stopped containers
	  - all networks not used by at least one container
	  - all images without at least one container associated to them
	  - all build cache

Delete only images and not its containers
	- docker image prune --all

Detached Mode (-d)
==================





I have a github repository where my ecomm application code is present
http://github.com/Sonal10409/ecomm.git
You have to deploy/place this code on a container, without creating a custom image

Answer:
- First we will clone the repo files from remote to local
- It will create a folder with name ecomm
- Files are now present in on my host machine path -> /root/ecomm
- So for this we will now we use volume concept to copy the files from /root/ecomm to container directory
	- because the image is httpd(apache) the container directory is going to be /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
the command to deploy
