SDLC and its phases

waterfall model
Agile model (Iterative model)
	- 2 team member
		Product owner
			user storties> functinality to be developed
		Scrum master
		
Version Control:
	multiple people can colaborate together
	maintain history of changes done by different people on the team
	
artifactories -> nexus, jfrog

elastic ip = static ip (paid service)


Linus command:
 clear -> clear the screen
 uname -> what operating system
 cat -> content of file
 pwd -> print working directory
 cd -> change directory
 ls -> list
 sudo (super user do) 
 sudo su  - 
 cat /etc/passwd
 adduser
 su - : switch user
 exit comeback to root user
 userdel -> deletes user
 :q! -> last command
 mkdir -> make directory
 touch -> create empty file
 echo (is a print command in linux)
 echo "hello" > file1 : add content in the file
 >> indicates append
 ctrl + d -> saves content to file
 vim file3 : into file3 (if file does not exists it creates the file)
 i : inserts data into file
 esc : to come out of existing model
 :wq -> save the file and come out of the file
 :q -> quit the file
 :q! -> forcibaly quit
 ls -al : list of file with details
 cp -> copy content of one file to new file
 sed -> modification command
 
 rm -rf <dir name>
	- forcefully removes dir (which is not empty)
 
 
 Editors in linus:
	vi
	vim
	nano
 
 
 user command -> shell -> kernel(responsible to execute command with the help of hardware components of OS)
 
 
 every command is a binary file executed by shell
 
 user and user management
 root user = admin 
 
 u -> file owner
 g -> all users of the same group
 o -> other users of linux OS
 a -> all the users of the OS(including the owner)
 
 Read => 4
 Write => 2
 Execute => 1
 - => 0
 
 U -> file owner => 6
 G -> group users => 4
 A -> others (everybody else) => 4
 
 Permissions:
 r = Read
 w = Write
 x = Execute
 - = no permission
 
 There are 3 sets of permission on any file or directory
	- we have 1 set of read/write/execute permission for owner of the file
	- we have 1 set of read/write/execute permission for group users
	- we have 1 set of read/write/execute permission for other users of linux os

-rw-rw-r--
- : its a file
d : its a directory
rw- : read/write/noExecute for owner of the file
rw- : read/write/noExecute for group users
r-- : read/noWrite/noExecute

drwxrwxr-x 2 devopsuser devopsuser   32 Aug  5 04:18 mydemo
-rw-rw-r-- 1 devopsuser devopsuser    0 Aug  5 04:17 filey

1 : single file
2 : no. of files in the directory
devopsuser : owner user
devopsuser : group of the user
32: size of the file
Aug  5 04:18: date and time when created
mydemo: name of file/directory

To edit the permission of file
	- using numbers
	- using characters

command to change permission of file/directory:
	chmod <permission> <filename>

E.g:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 devopsuser devopsuser   91 Aug  5 03:50 file6

sed -i s/<old text>/<newtext>/g <filename>

sed: modify
i: save
s: replace
<oldtext>: existing text from given file
<newtext>: new text that will replace old text
g: globally
<filename>: file that needs to be modified

sed i '/<text>/d' <filename>

d: delete (deletes entire line that has given text

grep "<text>" <filename>
 grep: searches the specified text in the given file
 
mv <filename> <directoryname>
	- moves the file to given directory
	
	
Process commands in Linus
	- top: this command will give all running process in your os
	- ps : gives snapshot list of all current process
	- ps aux: shows process by all users. displays the process user/owner also shows processes not attached to an app
	

ps -l -u <user>
	- lists processes by given user
	
pkill -9 29806
	- kill process
	- -9 is signal to kill
	- 29806 is PID

pkill -u <user>
	- kills all the processes of the user
	

How to check status for apache server
	- sudo systemctl status apache2.service
	
How to start apache server 
	- sudo systemctl start apache2.service
	
How to stop apache server:
	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
	OR
	systemctl stop apache2.service

How to switch user
	- su <username>
	
To get the information of all the paths associated with the apache2 web server, you can run the following command:
	- whereis apache2
	
How to uninstall apache2
	-sudo apt remove apache2
	
List of users
